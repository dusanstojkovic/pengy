**Pengy** is the system for monitoring of the air quality parameters.

The system concept and how it is build are described in the personal blog [quo.vadis.stojkovic.ch](https://quo.vadis.stojkovic.ch/air-pollution-monitor/)

## Description ðŸš§

The sensors on the nodes are measuring the relevant air parameters (t, RH, p, PM1.0, PM2.5, PM10 ...), data is acquiried with [*Heltect CubeCell (HTCC-AB01)*](https://heltec.org/project/htcc-ab01/) device and sent using *LoRaWAN* via *The Things Network* platform. Integration to *Thingy* as well to *Sensor Community* and *Pulse.Eco* platoforms is used for the visualization of the results.

ðŸš§

Depending on the version, different sensors are used, different parameters are measured.
In the current version (2.0), parameters that are measured are: 
- air temperature (t)
- air relative humidity (RH)
- atmospheric pressure (p)
- environmental noise
- respirable (<10Î¼m) particulate matter mass concetration (PM 10)
- fine (<2.5 Î¼m) particulate matter mass concetration (PM 2.5)
- ultra fine (<1 Î¼m) particulate matter mass concetration (PM 1)

using the following sensors:
- SPS30
- BME280
- MAX9814 amplifier based microphone

For the overview of the parameters and sensor used in previous version refer to:
- version 1.0 - https://github.com/dusanstojkovic/pengy/tree/v1.0
- version 1.5 - https://github.com/dusanstojkovic/pengy/tree/v1.5
